            <p>Extending across the north and south side of the Alps in west-central Europe, Switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited area of 41,285 square kilometres (15,940 sq mi). The population is about 8 million, resulting in an average population density of around 195 people per square kilometre (500/sq mi). The more mountainous southern half of the country is far more sparsely populated than the northern half. In the largest Canton of Graubünden, lying entirely in the Alps, population density falls to 27 /km2 (70 /sq mi).</p>

            <h5>The Aare River and view of the old city of Bern</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Bern</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Probably no one knows that Bern is the capital of Switzerland, believe it or not it’s not Zurich, or Geneva :). This tiny city is famous for its old city which is a UNESCO world heritage site, in addition to its exciting Aare River where you can take a cold dip, you can also visit the bear park “Bärenpark“, walk its bridges, and marvel at the scenery. Don’t forget to eat lots of chocolate from Bern’s famous Chocolatier Läderach, or go for the cheaper option Torino that you will find in every supermarket. To enjoy Swiss bakery Beck Glatz is a must try, savor their salmon sandwich, and their traditional Bernese cakes, and above all Raclette & Swiss Fondue from the traditional Lötschberg.

            <h5>The Chapel Bridge </h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Luzern</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                It’s enough to be walking by Lake Luzern while feeding the geese, enjoying an ice cream, or to-die-for Swiss chocolate from Bachmann, and crossing the city’s famous landmark of Chapel Bridge known as “Kapellbrücke” a wooden bridge first erected in the 14th century. It’s a very scenic city with many spots where you can enjoy a jaw dropping view of the city, offering a feeling of coziness, and belonging.

            <h5>Chateau de Chillon</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Montreux</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                A Swiss French Riviera that will take you to another era, a blend of Swiss beauty with a touch of French elegance all in one compact city. Taking a boat to discover the hidden beauty of Lake Geneva -a.k.a. Lac Leman- is a must, you’d be sailing in blue waters, surrounded by mountains, and unspoiled nature. For the boat you have got many options; as you can take a regular boat, or a hop-on hop-off. Take a walk to the famous Château de Chillon located in Veytaux, only 45 minutes walk from the boat station in Montreux, not only it’s an enjoyable walk by the lake, but also a beautifully colored by wine fields, houses and hotels built on green hills.

            <h5>Kleine Scheidegg</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Kleine Scheidegg</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                A hiking heaven; not as famous as the Jungfrau, hence less touristic, and less expensive, to get there you have to take a train that runs slowly on very steep hills via rack railways, therefore you literally have to be glued to your seat, having that said the ride is not for the faint-hearted, but once you arrive you’d know how worthy it was. You could go there to savor coffee or tea while enjoying an appealing mountainous view, and smell fresh air, or you could unleash the adventurous side of you, and follow one of the hiking trails, where at some point you will find yourself at a restaurant where you’d be served a “hiker’s meal” while enjoying an amazing view.
