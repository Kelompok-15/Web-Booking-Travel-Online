            <br>
            <h3>DANUBE PROMENADE</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The banks of the Danube river are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site so you should spend some time visiting the Danube Promenade. It’s also a great place to see many of Budapest’s best sights.

            <h5>SAINT STEPHEN’S BASILICA (ST. ISTVÁN’S BASILICA)</h5>

            <h3>SAINT STEPHEN’S BASILICA (ST. ISTVÁN’S BASILICA)</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Not only is Saint Stephen’s Basilica the largest church in Budapest but it also contains St. Stephen’s mummified right hand. Possibly more impressive are the views from the top of the church as it also offers the highest 360-degree views of the city.

            <h3>CASTLE HILL</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Perched above the city, Castle Hill is a must-visit neighborhood of Budapest. Some of the buildings date back to 14th and 15th centuries. Set aside a day to discover its winding cobble stone streets. The area also contains many of Budapest’s top attractions like Trinity Square, Matthias Church (Mátyás templom), Fishermen’s Bastion (Halászbástya), and Buda Castle.

            <h5>GREAT MARKET HALL</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>GREAT MARKET HALL</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Built in 1894, this massive indoor market draws a major crowd looking for  fruits, vegetables, prepared foods, and random souvenirs. It is a bit of a tourist trap as the prices are a lot higher than what you’d find over on the Buda side of the city. However, it’s a nice place to go for small bites and to look at the architecture of the hall.

            <h5>HOUSE OF TERROR</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>HOUSE OF TERROR</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The House of Terror is a museum detailing Budapest’s time under Nazi and communist rule — specially it focuses of the secret police of both parties. It’s housed in the secret police’s former headquarters (which was also their torture site). It’s a very interesting museum and it’s one of the cities most visited attractions.

            <h3>MEMENTO PARK</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The communist loved building statues and monuments so Budapest was full of them during their years behind the Iron Curtain. Once communism in Budapest ended the people tore down almost all these statues and put them in a park in the outskirts of town. Now it’s a fun place to go visit and get selfies with Stalin. It’s a bit of a pain to reach via public transport so a tour might be easier.

            <h3>CITY PARK</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                City Park is where people of Budapest go to escape the city (it’s also where you’ll find the Széchenyi Baths). In this 302 acres park, you’ll also find a zoo and a replica Transylvanian Vajdahunyad Castle. It’s a fun place to explore on a nice day.
