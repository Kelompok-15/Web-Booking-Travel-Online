            <h5>Eiffel Tower, Paris</h5>
            <br>
            <h3>Go to the top of the Eiffel Tower</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                There’s no mistaking it: the Eiffel Tower rips through the air like a giant. This impressive symbol of France can be seen from almost anywhere in the city. Reigning 324 meters high, the iron tower has dominated the Parisian horizon ever since the 1889 Universal Exhibition.Unbeatable sensations kick in as soon as you start climbing the Eiffel Tower. Seven million visitors make the trip every year, climbing its three levels to get to the very top. Paris seen from so high up is worth the detour -- and the climb! In fact, the higher you go the more the city reveals itself: monuments pop up here and there, cars zip along the streets like ants and even the landscape begins to change. Definitely a must-do for anyone who visits Paris!                Don’t forget that the Eiffel Tower takes on a different person at night. Twinkling and shining above the “City of Lights,” as Paris is nicknamed, you can also take in the Eiffel Tower during the evening while enjoying a gastronomic meal at one of its restaurants such as the 58 on the first level, the Jules Verne on the second level, or even a glass of champagne at the very top.

            <h3>Take a River Boat Cruise on the Seine</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Traditional, elegant riverboats offer an alternative way to discover the City of Lights. Once onboard navigating past monuments and buildings, you’ll be able to fully enjoy your time on the Seine.
                The Seine has always been and forever will be the artery that runs through the heart of Paris. Geographically speaking, the river is the capital’s central axis and has always played a major role in Paris’s history. Identified as a territorial and economic advantage, the Seine has accompanied -- if not at times led -- Paris’s growth. Several landmarks throughout the city attest to this rich past.
                Bay windows provide sweeping views of the Seine and its banks. As if you were living a daydream, taking a cruise on the riverboat is a fantastic way to spend quality time with loved ones. Why not get engaged or ask for your partner’s hand in marriage? The riverboat cruise is indeed the perfect romantic setting to declare your love to the world -- and to the one you love of course!

            <h3>Paris by Night: Spend an exceptional evening at the Moulin Rouge</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The Moulin Rouge is Paris’s number 1 show, if not Europe’s. For more than 126 years, the most legendary French cabaret has been welcoming spectators from all over the world to see the famous French Cancan dance firsthand.
                Around the globe, the Moulin Rouge is appreciated and admired by spectators and performers alike. From Mistinguett and Edith Piaf to Jean Gabin, Frank Sinatra, and Liza Minnelli, the Moulin Rouge has welcomed some of the world’s greatest stage performers. The cabaret was further immortalized thanks to the famous painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec whose posters and paintings still contribute to Moulin Rouge’s international notoriety. 
                The lights dim, the curtains open...the entire troupe enters on stage and spectators can take in the beauty of the Doriss Girls and Doriss Dancers. These 80 artists recruited around the world don a total of 1,000 costumes decorated with feathers, rhinestones, and glitter that are made by Paris’s most famous workshops. Sumptuous decoration in flashy colors and one-of-a-kind designs created by Italian artists liven up the stage. Now it’s time to sit back and enjoy the show with its numerous original musical scores. Don’t forget the incredible leg-lifts by the most beautiful girls in the world!

            <h3>Admire the Notre-Dame Cathedral of Paris</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Notre-Dame is a masterpiece of French Gothic architecture. Initially spearheaded by bishop Maurice de Sully, the cathedral’s construction spanned for more than two decades: from the beginning of the 11th century to the first half of the 14th century. The cathedral has been a firsthand witness to several historical events such as the arrival of the Holy Crown in 1239, the exoneration of Joan of Arc in 1456 and the coronation of Napoléon I in 1804.
                Although the monument is known for its structural harmony when looking attentively one can make out various minor, asymmetric elements that were introduced to avoid the monotony typical of classic gothic architecture.
                Its spectacular rose windows, precious objects and magnificent bells are all symbols of this architectural masterpiece. Before the huge fire that hit the cathedral on April 15. 2019, people could visit its towers allowing to access the Galerie des Chimères (Chimera Hall) before continuing to the top of the South tower where, in the company of frightening but intriguing gargoyles, the city of Paris could be seen.

            <h3>Visit the Louvre Museum</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                The controversial glass pyramid located in the Napoléon courtyard rapidly became symbolic of the museum. The 13th century Philippe Auguste fort that surrounds the museum was reorganized until becoming the royal residence for several centuries. It wasn’t until 1793 that it became the Central Museum of Arts, France’s first national museum. Year after year the museum’s collections grew larger, thereby taking up more and more place at the palace.
                Today, the immensity of the Louvre is mind-boggling: it has been estimated that nine months are needed to see each and every work of art on display. The Louvre is indeed one of the world’s biggest museum; its exhibition surface area of 18 acres displays 38,000 works of art out of the 460,000 that the museum possesses within its walls.
                These exceptionally rich works of art are spread out in 8 main galleries: Oriental Antiquities, Egyptian Antiquities, Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities, Islamic Arts, Decorative Arts, Sculptures, Paintings, and Graphic Art.

            <h3>Visit the Garnier Opera House</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Apollo still clutches his golden lyre high on the Garnier Palace, one god among many who keeps an eye on things. Upon entering the opera, one notes how the building opens up and spreads out like tentacles, each part revealing a specific purpose that lends even more theatrical airs to the opera.
                This neoclassical masterpiece was created by the architect Charles Garnier at the end of the Second Empire. Inaugurated in 1875 as the “New Opera” in a Haussmannian Paris, it fascinated onlookers with its ornate richness, eclecticism, architectural and decorative audaciousness. Garnier brought together France’s best artisans, painters, and sculptors. And for the first time in France, Garnier used mosaic to decorate the gallery vaults that lead to the grand hall. The Garnier Opera has become one of the most spectacular Italian-inspired theaters.            
                If you’re interested in going to the Garnier Opera, it’s worth noting that its ballets, operas, concerts, and recitals are not unaffordable.
